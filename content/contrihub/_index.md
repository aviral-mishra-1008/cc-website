**ContriHub** is our annual month-long celebration of open source contributions. Every October-November, we organize a beginner-friendly event where students make their first (or continued) contributions to open source projects.

> Unlike competitive coding events, ContriHub focuses on **learning, collaboration, and community building** - not rankings or leaderboards.

## What is ContriHub?

ContriHub is more than just a contribution event - it's a supportive environment where:

- **🌱 Beginners feel welcome** - No prior experience required
- **🤝 Community helps each other** - Seniors mentor juniors
- **🎯 All contributions count equally** - Features, bugs, docs, tests all matter
- **🌟 Learning is celebrated** - Growth over numbers
- **💡 Diverse skills are valued** - Not just coding!

## How It Works

### 1. Event Period (October 15 - November 15)

A month-long window to make contributions at your own pace. No pressure, no rush.

### 2. Choose Your Repositories

We curate a list of **club repositories** and **beginner-friendly open source projects**:
- CC Club Website
- DSA Practice Platform
- Alumni Portal
- Community-maintained tools
- Selected external projects with good documentation

### 3. Pick Your Contribution Type

**All of these count equally**:

- 📚 **Documentation** - Improve docs, add examples
- 🧪 **Testing** - Write tests, improve coverage
