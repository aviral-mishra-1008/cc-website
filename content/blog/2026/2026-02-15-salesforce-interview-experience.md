## Overview

{% alert_info() %}
**Salesforce** is a San-Francisco based Multi-national company which is often regarded as world's best AI-CRM firm. Overall, the internship experience at Salesforce is amazing, and so is the compensation offered.
{% end %}

## Internship Pathways

A big chunk of the hiring at Salesforce at entry level happens through PPO conversions post summer internship. There are two ways to land an internship at Salesforce:

1. {% badge_primary() %}On-campus{% end %} Salesforce visits MNNIT Allahabad for summer internship. The process involves an online round (OA) followed by 2 rounds of interview for each shortlisted candidate.

2. {% badge_secondary() %}Off-campus{% end %} Salesforce often organizes a hackathon (usually called Tech Accelerator). To be aware of when these happen you can check out the {{ pretty_link(url="https://www.salesforce.com/company/careers/university/", title="FutureForce Page", description="Salesforce University Recruiting") }} or follow [FutureForce on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/salesforcefutureforce/).

   > Usually the process involves a resume based shortlisting for the hackathon after which the shortlisted candidates are invited to Salesforce Hyderabad Office for a hackathon. Interviews are conducted post hackathon and internships are awarded. If you get shortlisted for hackathon, there is a decent chance of qualifying for internships through this route.

## On-campus Process

### Online Assessment

The Salesforce online assessment is a timed challenge which is usually organized on HackerRank.

- **Format:** 2-3 DSA questions only (No MCQs).
- **Difficulty:** Leetcode Easy to Medium.

{% alert_warning() %}
**Topics:** Greedy, 2 Pointer, Binary Search.
*Note: The topics may differ and are very hard to predict.*
{% end %}

### Interviews (Round 1)

The candidates shortlisted for interview go through the first round which is a technical round.

- **Content:** DSA questions followed by development stack/projects questions.
- **Ratio:** 70-80% DSA (Leetcode Medium), 20-30% Dev/Projects.

> The development stack questions are fundamental in nature and can be answered easily if you made the project yourself.

{% alert_info() %}
**Pro Tip:** Your best chances are if you don't behave like a robot!
{% end %}

One of the prime focus of the interviewers is on your ability to develop a solution and explain your reasoning.
- Speak while you code.
- Explain choices for data structures.
- Discuss expected time complexity.
- If you make a mistake, point it out and correct it.

#### Introduction

{% collapse(title="How to Introduce Yourself") %}
Prepare a good introduction, usually interviewers ask for your introduction at the start and just saying, "Hi! I am xyz from MNNIT pursuing B.Tech in x branch and I am good in coding" will not be very impactful, so yes that works, but ideally your introduction should be a 1-2 minute quick summary of the highlights of your resume.

it should be **90%** about your skills, projects, CGPA, achievements and interests and **10%** about your non-academic, non-coding skills and passion which could be any small mention like "In my free time I love to play basketball/I love to sing/I am a travel freak and I love to explore nature etc."
{% end %}

### Interview (Round 2)

Be ready to be asked the introduction you gave in Round 1. This is generally an **HR-Manager round**. managers try to test your culture fit/critical thinking. Expect puzzles and managerial questions.

**Common Questions:**
1. Tell me about your weakness.
2. What is your favorite subject?
3. What are your greatest achievements?

{% alert_error() %}
**Never say a true weakness!**
You can say anything that initially sounds negative but adds more value to you.

*Example:* "My weakness is that when I delve into a project I get so involved in it that I forget about food..."
{% end %}

### Conclusion

So ultimately they will ask you: **"Are there any questions?"**

{% alert_success() %}
**This is the bingo moment!** You should always ask a question.
{% end %}

Read about the company, what are their latest products and what they are investing on.

{% collapse(title="Example Questions to Ask") %}
1. "So sir, what is Agentforce all about and how is this revolutionizing the CRM Landscape?"
2. "So, I heard trust is the number 1 value at Salesforce, how do developers transform into their daily work?"
{% end %}

> **Note:** Do not ask about work life balance or compensation. It puts you in a favorable position to ask company-oriented questions.

## My Internship Experience

I joined Salesforce as a summer intern in 2025. The experience was amazing!

- **Stipend:** Great
- **Location:** Hyderabad Office
- **Culture:** Warm and welcoming

The office food is great, and the employee perks as well. My team was particularly very warm and welcoming, and I personally learnt a lot.

### Projects Delivered

I delivered two projects during my internship:

1. An **MCP Server** for realtime Jenkins Build Monitoring and Bug-Fixes
2. A distributed multi-threaded priority based **Gateway Service** to deliver webhooks.

{% end %}

### Final Advice

My mentor at Salesforce was from MNNIT Batch 2019 itself! Apart from that, the entire team was very approachable and so was the case with all other interns.

{% alert_success() %}
**Seek Help!**
During internship don't stay stuck. Try things, but if they don't work out, don't waste days fixing it. You will learn a lot from your team's principal engineer and architects, because their perspective will teach you about developing a product from the lenses of the end-user.
{% end %}

PPO conversions are quite generous at Salesforce given you deliver the project on time. The manager 1 on 1s are amazing and you can share feedback with your team. If you make it Hyderabad office, always make sure to try Andhra-food cause its amazing!

## Best of Luck Dude :)
