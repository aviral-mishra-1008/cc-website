## The Journey: Day by Day

### Day 0: Registration and Kick-off (Friday Evening)

The excitement was palpable as teams checked in at the main auditorium. After a brief opening ceremony, our faculty advisor Prof. Rajesh Kumar welcomed participants and emphasized the importance of learning over winning.

**Keynote Speaker**: Vikram Singh (SDE-2, Google, CC Alumni 2020) shared his hackathon experiences and offered valuable advice:

> "Focus on solving a real problem. The best hackathon projects are those that you're passionate about. Don't try to impress judges with complex tech - impress them with thoughtful solutions."

Teams received their problem statements and immediately dove into brainstorming sessions. The energy in the room was electric!

### Day 1: Building and Prototyping (Saturday)

Teams worked tirelessly through the night, fueled by coffee, snacks, and determination. The venue buzzed with activity:
