## The API Debate

GraphQL has gained massive popularity, but is it always better than REST? Let's compare objectively.

## REST API

**Pros:**
- Simple and well-understood
- Great caching support
- Works with any HTTP client

**Cons:**
- Over-fetching data
- Multiple endpoints
- Versioning challenges

## GraphQL

**Pros:**
- Request exactly what you need
- Single endpoint
- Strong typing
- Real-time with subscriptions

**Cons:**
- Caching complexity
- Learning curve
- Query complexity limits

## When to Use Each

Choose REST for simple CRUD apps. Choose GraphQL for complex data requirements with multiple clients.
