## Security First

Security isn't optional. Learn to protect your apps from day one.

## Common Vulnerabilities

### 1. SQL Injection
```javascript
// Vulnerable
db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`);

// Safe
db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [userId]);
```

### 2. XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
Always sanitize user input before rendering.

### 3. CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
Use CSRF tokens for state-changing operations.

## Security Checklist

- ✅ Use HTTPS everywhere
- ✅ Hash passwords (bcrypt)
- ✅ Implement rate limiting
- ✅ Validate all inputs
- ✅ Keep dependencies updated
