# Learning Roadmaps

Structured learning paths to help you master different technical domains. Each roadmap includes milestones, resources, time estimates, and project ideas.



## How to Use These Roadmaps

1. **Choose your goal** - Pick a roadmap aligned with your interests
2. **Follow sequentially** - Each level builds on previous knowledge
3. **Do the projects** - Theory + Practice = Learning
4. **Track progress** - Mark milestones as you complete them
5. **Join community** - Learn together, share progress, ask questions

## Customizing Your Path

These roadmaps are guides, not rigid rules:

- **Skip topics you know** - No need to start from zero if you have experience
- **Go deeper where interested** - Explore topics that excite you
- **Adjust time estimates** - Everyone learns at their own pace
- **Combine roadmaps** - Mix and match based on your goals
