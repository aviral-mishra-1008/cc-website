# Web Development Roadmap

## 1. Web Development

### Overview
**What is Web Development?**  
Web Development is the art of building and maintaining websites and web applications. It's broadly split into **Frontend** (what users see and interact with) and **Backend** (the server-side logic and database management).

**Why Learn It?**  
- **Visual Feedback**: You see the results of your code immediately.
- **Creativity Meets Logic**: It combines design aesthetics with programming problem-solving.
- **JavaScript**: You learn the most popular programming language in the world.
- **Evergreen Skill**: The internet isn't going anywhere. Every business needs a web presence.

**Real-Life Applications**  
- **E-commerce**: Amazon, Flipkart (shopping, payments, user accounts).
- **Social Media**: Instagram, Twitter (feeds, likes, real-time chats).
- **Dashboards**: Analytics tools, admin panels, notion-like productivity apps.
- **SaaS**: Google Docs, Figma (complex applications running in the browser).

**Career Relevance**  
- **High Demand**: Every company needs web developers.
- **Freelancing**: Easy to start taking on clients for websites or small apps.
- **Full Stack Potential**: Mastering both allows you to build entire products solo.

## 2. Learning Path Breakdown

### Stage 1 — Fundamentals
**Duration**: 3–4 weeks  
**Objective**: Build static websites, version control them, and deploy them live.

**You Learn:**
- **Key Concepts**: How the web works (Client/Server, DNS, HTTP), Semantic HTML, CSS Box Model.
- **Basic Tools**: 
    - **Editor**: VS Code (Extensions: Prettier, Live Server).
    - **Browser**: Chrome DevTools.
    - **Version Control**: Git & GitHub (Committing, Pushing, Branching).
- **Theory Essentials**:
    - **HTML5**: Structure, Forms, SEO basics.
    - **CSS3**: Selectors, Flexbox, Grid, Responsive Design (Media Queries).
    - **JavaScript (ES6)**: Variables, Loops, Functions, DOM Manipulation, Events.
- **Deployment**: Getting your site live using Netlify or GitHub Pages.

**Hands-On Tasks:**
1.  **Personal Portfolio**: A simple static site introducing yourself with a "Contact Me" form. Deploy it to GitHub Pages.
2.  **Product Landing Page**: Clone the layout of a product page (e.g., Apple or Nike) using only HTML/CSS.
3.  **Interactive Quiz**: A simple JS app that asks 5 questions and shows a score.

**Resources:**
- **HTML/CSS**: [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) (The Bible of Web Dev), [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/).
- **JavaScript**: [JavaScript for the Haters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Akk7t6r6M6w) (Video), [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/).
- **Git**: [Git & GitHub Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk).

### Stage 2 — Core Development
**Duration**: 1–2 months  
**Objective**: Build dynamic, data-driven web applications using modern frameworks.

**You Learn:**
- **Frontend Framework (React)**:
    - Components, Props, State (useState, useEffect).
    - React Router (Single Page Applications).
    - Fetching Data from APIs.
- **Styling Frameworks**:
    - **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Backend Basics (Node.js)**:
    - Runtime environment, NPM.
    - **Express.js**: Building simple REST APIs.
- **Database**:
    - **MongoDB**: NoSQL basics, CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- **Tooling**: Postman (API Testing).

**Hands-On Tasks:**
1.  **Weather App**: Fetch data from OpenWeatherMap API and display it based on user search. Style with Tailwind.
2.  **Task Manager (Full Stack)**:
    - **Frontend**: React app to add/delete/complete tasks.
    - **Backend**: Express API to save tasks to MongoDB.
3.  **Assignments**:
    - Build a "Simon Says" game in pure JS.
    - Rebuild your Portfolio using React and Tailwind CSS.

**Resources:**
- **React**: [Official React Docs](https://react.dev/), [React Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8).
- **Tailwind CSS**: [Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).
- **Backend**: [Node.js Docs](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/), [Express Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L72fhGm1tfE).
- **Database**: [MongoDB University](https://university.mongodb.com/).

### Stage 3 — Advanced / Specialization
**Duration**: 2–3 months  
**Objective**: Production-grade development, performance, and best practices.

**You Learn:**

    - **API Design**: REST best practices.
- **Performance**: Code splitting, Lazy loading, Image optimization.

**Hands-On Tasks:**
1.  **Social Media Clone (e.g., Twitter/Reddit Lite)**:
    - Features: Auth, Infinite Scroll, Likes, Comments, Real-time updates.
2.  **Open Source Contribution**: Find a "good first issue" on GitHub and contribute.
3.  **Club Project**: Contribute to the PClub website or similar initiative.

**Resources:**
- **Next.js**: [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs).
- **TypeScript**: [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/).
