&lt;p&gt;Learning a video game for the first time is rarely smooth. You press random buttons, lose repeatedly, make mistakes, and slowly begin to understand what works and what does not. Over time, without reading any manual, you get better. This natural learning process closely mirrors how Reinforcement Learning works.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement Learning is a branch of machine learning where an agent learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. Video games provide a simple and intuitive way to understand this concept because they naturally involve decision-making, consequences, and improvement over time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</summary>
